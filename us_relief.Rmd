# The Overall Idea

- Start with a county-, state-, or other map of the United States. 
- Get raster files of terrain relief data from satellite imagery.
- _Crop_ the raster files to the US map area.
- _Mask_ the raster with the borders of the US.
- Generate a "hillside-shaded relief" representation of the cropped and masked area.
- Plot it.

The tips on how to generate a good-looking relief shading come from this [very good tutorial](https://stanford.edu/~vbauer/teaching/hillshade.html) by Vincent Bauer.

# Getting the Map Data

For the U.S. map, I'm going to use the county-level map contained in the `ussf` package. (More about that and related packages [here](https://dcl-docs.stanford.edu/)). This map includes the lower 48 states, and also a rescaled and relocated Hawaii and Alaska. We're using the County boundaries at a moderate resolution, but this package also includes State data. 

```{r get-ussf}
## remotes::install_github("dcl-docs/ussf")
```

There are several sources for terrain relief data. I used the [NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data](http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfinderpanoramas_org15.htm). I can't store these files in the repository, because they're too big, but the idea is to download the four tiles that cover the United States. These are the four in the top left of the map at the link, numbered 15-A, 15-B, 15-G, and 15-H. Click on each tile to download it to disk and then put it into the `raw/nasa/` folder in the repository. The files are big: about 330MB each.

## Load the county map

We temporarily adjust the projection of the county map to make it the same as the raster tiles. 

```{r county-data}
## The projection we'll use while cleaning
proj_base <- CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84") # default WGS84 projection

## try geography = "state" to get the state map
counties <- st_transform(ussf::boundaries(geography = "county"), proj_base)

```

## Load in the relief tiles

The tiles are big. Be patient throughout the next few chunks of code. 

```{r make-mosaic, cache=TRUE}

files <- fs::dir_ls(here("raw/nasa"))
rasters_list <- map(files, raster::raster)
names(rasters_list) <- NULL ## A quick of the mosaic() function we're about to use
rasters_list$fun <- mean    ## requires this

## This will take a little while. We're creating mosaic objects
## from each tile
mosaic_out <- do.call(raster::mosaic, rasters_list)
```

# Crop and Mask the Raster

One nice thing about the cropping and masking process is that it understands that we've moved Alaska and Hawaii. Neat! Again, this next chunk is going to take a while to run. (On the order of "Go get a cup of coffee" time. Perhaps also make a sandwich.) Cropping restricts our mosaic to the bounding box of the US County map. Masking places the US County map area over the terrain mosaic so that's all we'll see of the terrain data.

```{r crop-and-mask, cache=TRUE}

cropped_mosaic <- raster::crop(mosaic_out, counties) # be patient
masked_mosaic <- raster::mask(cropped_mosaic, counties) # be even more patient

## Now re-project the relief raster into a nice Albers equal-area projection
ea_proj <- st_crs(ussf::boundaries(geography = "county"))$proj4string
us_relief <- raster::projectRaster(masked_mosaic, crs = ea_proj) # be patient again

## Check
plot(us_relief)
```


Now we have a relief map of the US, with Alaska and Hawaii included off the California coast.


## Hillshading effects make the relief map look nicer

We multiply by 15 to exaggerate the height of the reliefs, as is conventional for this sort of map. This is because, relative to how large the land area is, mountains are not very tall. 

```{r hillshading, cache=TRUE}
slope <- raster::terrain(us_relief * 15, opt = "slope", unit = "radians")
aspect <- raster::terrain(us_relief * 15, opt = "aspect", unit= "radians")
hillshade <- raster::hillShade(slope, aspect, angle = 45, direction = 315)

## Check
## plot(hillshade, col = gray.colors(20, start = 0, end = 1))

## Smooth the hillshader some more

hillshade2 <- raster::aggregate(hillshade, fact = 5 , method = "bilinear" )
hillshade2 <- raster::focal(hillshade2, w = matrix(1/9, nc = 3, nr = 3), mean)

## Check
## plot(hillshade2, col = gray.colors(20, start = 0, end = 1))

slope2 <- raster::aggregate(slope, fact = 5 , method = "bilinear" )
slope2 <- raster::focal(slope2, w = matrix(1/9, nc = 3, nr = 3), mean)

##  Check
plot(hillshade2, col = gray.colors(20, start = 0, end = 1))
plot(slope2, col = grey.colors(100, start = 1, end = 0), legend = F, alpha = .2, add = TRUE)

```

# Convert to a data frame and use with ggplot

```{r hillshade-df}

hills_df <- raster::rasterToPoints(hillshade2)
hills_df <-  data.frame(hills_df)
colnames(hills_df) <- c("lon", "lat", "hills")

slope_df <- raster::rasterToPoints(slope2)
slope_df <-  data.frame(slope_df)
colnames(slope_df) <- c("lon", "lat", "slope")
#slope_df$slope <- 1 - slope_df$slope

```

```{r create-base-layer}

base_layer <- ggplot(data = hills_df,
                     mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
    geom_tile(aes(lon, lat, fill = hills, group = 1), 
                alpha = .9) +
     geom_tile(data = slope_df, aes(lon, lat, fill = slope, group = 2), 
                 alpha = .7) 

base_out <- base_layer + 
  scale_fill_continuous_sequential(palette = "Inferno", rev = FALSE) + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  coord_equal() + 
  theme_void()

ggsave(file = "figures/base-out-inferno.png", 
       plot = base_out, width = 12, height=7, units="in")

```

```{r plot-base-layer}
include_graphics("figures/base-out-inferno.png")
```


```{r create-base-and-boundary}
counties <- ussf::boundaries(geography = "county")

out <- base_layer + 
      scale_fill_continuous_sequential(palette = "Grays") + 
  geom_sf(data = counties, 
          fill = NA,
          size = 0.05,
          inherit.aes = FALSE,
          color = "firebrick", 
          alpha = 0.3) + 
  coord_sf() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  theme_void()


ggsave(file = "figures/base-and-county.png", 
       plot = out, width = 12, height=7, units="in")

```

```{r plot-base-and-boundary}

# Save the base layer object

save(base_layer, file = "data/base_layer.Rda")
